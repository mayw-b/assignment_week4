** JavaScript Functions ** Create a file called functions.js and complete the following exercises. Remember to test your code as you go!

Question 1: Function Basics

Write a JavaScript function named calculateArea that calculates and returns the area of a rectangle. The function should take two parameters: length and width. Test your function by calling it with different values.

Question 2: Scope Exploration

Declare a variable globalVar in the global scope and give it a value.
Inside a function, declare a variable localVar and give it a different value.
Attempt to access both globalVar and localVar within the function.
Write comments explaining your observations about variable scope.
Question 3: Closures and Private Counters

Create a function called counter that returns another function. The inner function should increment and return a counter variable each time it's called. Use closures to achieve this. Test your counter function by creating multiple counters and incrementing them separately.

Question 4 & 5 is not required, but is a bonus challenge.

Question 4: Function Expressions

Write a function expression named calculate that takes two parameters: num1 and num2. The function should return an object with the following properties:

sum - the sum of num1 and num2.
difference - the absolute difference between num1 and num2.
product - the product of num1 and num2.
quotient - the result of dividing num1 by num2.
Question 5: Callback Functions

Create a function called performOperation that takes two numbers and a callback function as parameters. The performOperation function should call the callback function, passing the two numbers as arguments, and return the result.

Write three separate callback functions:

One that adds the two numbers.
One that subtracts the second number from the first.
One that multiplies the numbers.
